# project3-back-end

##Dec 10
-By Friday, our back end repo looks to be fully built out.
-Question. do we need the seed.js file. What does it do. should we delete the .json data.
Does that also meant to take out all .json refrence in index.js

Also, do i need to redeploy the back-end . that we made changes to controllers.
